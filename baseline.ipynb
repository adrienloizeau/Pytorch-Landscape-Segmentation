It takes around a minute to load one epoch, which can be a huge overhead if you want to train for e.g. 100 epochs. The reason is that the images are quite large (some around 3000x4000) and loading such images takes a lot of time. Ideally, for this dataset you should have dataloaders that load one epoch in a few seconds at max. To achieve this we can do a few things:\n\n1. We could pre-process the images. Reszing the images beforehand to the desired height and width, will significantly decrease the loading time.\n2. We could increase the number of workers.

From here, you can improve in various ways. This is a good practice in general: start with a simple baseline solution and try to improve from there. Below we outline a couple ideas you can try out but keep in mind that this is not an exhaustive list! It's often the unique ideas that give you an edge in Kaggle challenges.\n\n### 1. Improving the speed of iteration\nOne of the best practices both in industry and on Kaggle is to create a pipeline in which you can iterate ideas quickly. It should take you no more than 20min (for this dataset) to train and evaluate a model. It doesn't mean that your final soultion should be trained in 20mins but it means that if you want to change some model parameters/data variants/training properties, you should be able to assess if your new idea is worth more of your efforts in about that much time. How you could speed up the above timeline:\n- Include preprocessing step. Instead of loading large (4000x3000) images in the dataloader, resize them beforehand\n- Increase number of workers in the dataloader\n- Set up a better evaluation metric than accuracy. Ideally, it should be in line with the evaluation metric of the competition. This will allow your validation set to give a good approximation of your performance on the leaderboard\n- Use GPUs for training. This can drive down your training time from hours to just minutes. Easy two options are: Google Colab (10 euro a month), or Kaggle (free but limit of 33 GPU hours per week - should be enough honestly)\n\n### 2. Improving performance\nOnce you are able to iterate quickly here are a few ideas on how you could improve performance:\n- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Think of the key problems with the dataset and how you could tackle them.\n- Include transformations for you training set. You can use [native PyTorch transformations](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/transforms.html) or I can recommend the [Albumentations library](https://albumentations.ai/) specifically designed for image transformations. Nice tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAdLwKJBvPM)\n- Try different architectures - Unet is a good start\n- Improve your understanding of the training process. You could plot loss/accuracy/other metrics over time to get an idea of how many epochs you need to reach convergence. You could even use an experiment tracking software such as [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site)\n- Experiment with different learning rates. You could even use a [learning rate scheduler](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#how-to-adjust-learning-rate)\n- Experiment with different loss functions\n- Experiment with different image sizes\n- Use transfer learning. This means you would need to obtain a semantic segmentation model from somewhere (no links here :) ) and replace the last layer to output 25 channels (because we have 25 classes in our dataset). Keep in mind that models pretrained on seemingly unrelated datasets like Imagenet can still work here! This is because the lower-level layers learn simple features such as lines, shapes, and colours, which can be useful for our problem as well.\n- Think of a better train/validation split\n\n<br>\n\nThis is already a lot of things to implement. Given that you have limited time, try to implement a few and maybe some of your own ideas and your leaderboard score surely will improve.
